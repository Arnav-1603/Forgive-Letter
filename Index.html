        <h1>To My Dearest...</h1>
        <p>
            My heart is heavy with regret, and my soul doth yearn for thy forgiveness.  
            If I have erred, know that it was never my intent to wound thee.  
            Each moment apart doth weigh upon me, and I long to see thy smile once more.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If thou canst find it within thy heart to grant me pardon,  
            I shall cherish thy mercy as a traveler doth cherish the light of dawn.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever thine,  
            <br>â€” Thy Most Regretful Admirer
        </p>
