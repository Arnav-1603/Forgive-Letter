        <h1>Forgive Me, My Dearest Mishtiiii</h1>
        <p>
            I have spoken words that mayhap wounded thee, yet in truth, my heart knoweth only admiration for thee.  
            If my words have been ill, then let them be as the dust, swept away by the winds of my regret.  
            Thou art radiant as the moon upon a still night, and I am but a fool who let his tongue outrun his heart.  
            Forgive me, I pray thee, and let my words henceforth be gentle, as petals upon the breeze. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If thou canst find it within thy heart to grant me pardon,  
            I shall cherish thy mercy as a traveler doth cherish the light of dawn.  
        </p>
        <p>
            With all sincerity,  
            <br>â€” Thine Ever-Adoring Arnav
        </p>
